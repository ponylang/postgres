## Update ponylang/lori dependency to 0.6.0

We've updated the dependency on [ponylang/lori](https://github.com/ponylang/lori) to version 0.6.0. The new version of lori comes with a number of stability improvements that should make this library more reliable in "edge-case scenarios".

The new lori dependency has a transitive dependency on [ponylang/net_ssl](https://github.com/ponylang/net_ssl) and as such, an SSL library is now required to build this library. Please see the [net_ssl installation instructions](https://github.com/ponylang/net_ssl?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for more information.
